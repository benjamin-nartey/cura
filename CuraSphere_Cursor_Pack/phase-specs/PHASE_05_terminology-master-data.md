# PHASE 05 — Terminology & Master Data

**Authority:** Derived execution plan from *CuraSphere Engineering Specification Pack v1.0*, §12, Phase 05. **Original authoritative scope and exit criteria are reproduced below verbatim**. All entity/API/UI/feature breakdowns below are implementation proposals, not additional claims made by the original document.

## 1. Original specification — authoritative

Create terminology service and controlled vocabularies to prevent semantic drift.

**Original scope:**
- SNOMED/LOINC/ICD/UCUM mappings
- local terminology extensions
- versioned code systems/value sets
- formularies and facility catalogs

**Original exit criteria — all mandatory:**
- [ ] Unknown codes fail safely
- [ ] Terminology versions are recorded with clinical records
- [ ] Mapping provenance is visible

## 2. Proposed bounded context and implementation contracts

- **Bounded context / module:** Terminology and facility catalogs
- **Candidate schema/entities:** CodeSystemVersion, ValueSet, Concept, Mapping, UnitDefinition, FormularyItem, CatalogItem, MappingAudit.
- **Candidate interfaces (routes/events are proposals, version/authorization required):** /v1/terminology/lookup, /validate, /translate, /expand, /catalogs.
- **Expected UI/UX surfaces (implement only when phase permits product UI):** Terminology search/selector, mapping review, unknown-code warning, catalog management.
- **Dependencies:** All prior phases must have signed-off acceptance evidence. Cross-phase libraries may be referenced, not preemptively implemented here. All external dependencies are behind versioned, tested interfaces.
- **Data authority:** Authoritative services own source facts. Projections, twins, AI artifacts, graph claims, search indexes, caches and analytics are derived; store source ID/version and freshness. For each entity decide tenant/facility scope, permitted purposes and retention before migration.
- **Suggested implementation approach:** Use source-stack baseline unless actual repository has documented, accepted alternative. Create schema/constraints/migrations first (except Phase 00), implement service APIs and durable events, wire role-aware UX, then observability/CI/deployment; apply the micro-cycle for every feature below.

## 3. Numbered feature build order — one complete feature at a time

### Feature 1 — Controlled code-system storage (`P05-F01`)

**Implement in sequence (with global 10-step micro-cycle):** Version SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10/11 and UCUM metadata with licensed content only; record provenance, code system URI, edition and active dates.

**Evidence needed to accept this feature:** Reference records encode system+code+version; license requirements documented.

**Do not advance until:** real data persistence and API/event contract (if applicable), usable role-appropriate UI or explicit N/A, permission checks, audit, seeded realistic synthetic scenario, relevant edge/failure test, automated execution report, safe degradation/rollback and documentation are all complete and reviewed. Update feature register with path and test evidence; no unchecked criterion is implicitly waived.
### Feature 2 — Validation and canonical units (`P05-F02`)

**Implement in sequence (with global 10-step micro-cycle):** Create code/value-set validation, UCUM conversion service with dimensional checks, explicit unknown/ambiguous fallback and deterministic rounding rules.

**Evidence needed to accept this feature:** Mismatched unit types or unknown codes fail safely.

**Do not advance until:** real data persistence and API/event contract (if applicable), usable role-appropriate UI or explicit N/A, permission checks, audit, seeded realistic synthetic scenario, relevant edge/failure test, automated execution report, safe degradation/rollback and documentation are all complete and reviewed. Update feature register with path and test evidence; no unchecked criterion is implicitly waived.
### Feature 3 — Mapping adjudication (`P05-F03`)

**Implement in sequence (with global 10-step micro-cycle):** Store source->target mappings with equivalence, confidence (if approved), reviewer, version and effective interval; never silently choose a non-equivalent match.

**Evidence needed to accept this feature:** Ambiguous mappings queue for human review.

**Do not advance until:** real data persistence and API/event contract (if applicable), usable role-appropriate UI or explicit N/A, permission checks, audit, seeded realistic synthetic scenario, relevant edge/failure test, automated execution report, safe degradation/rollback and documentation are all complete and reviewed. Update feature register with path and test evidence; no unchecked criterion is implicitly waived.
### Feature 4 — Facility formulary and catalogs (`P05-F04`)

**Implement in sequence (with global 10-step micro-cycle):** Support local drugs, procedures, tests, units, status and versioned overrides per facility with safe global defaults.

**Evidence needed to accept this feature:** An archived order preserves original catalog version.

**Do not advance until:** real data persistence and API/event contract (if applicable), usable role-appropriate UI or explicit N/A, permission checks, audit, seeded realistic synthetic scenario, relevant edge/failure test, automated execution report, safe degradation/rollback and documentation are all complete and reviewed. Update feature register with path and test evidence; no unchecked criterion is implicitly waived.
### Feature 5 — Terminology UX and conformance (`P05-F05`)

**Implement in sequence (with global 10-step micro-cycle):** Enforce code pickers on clinical forms and show descriptions, mappings, revisions and errors without free-text code corruption.

**Evidence needed to accept this feature:** All representative clinical writes carry coded-system metadata.

**Do not advance until:** real data persistence and API/event contract (if applicable), usable role-appropriate UI or explicit N/A, permission checks, audit, seeded realistic synthetic scenario, relevant edge/failure test, automated execution report, safe degradation/rollback and documentation are all complete and reviewed. Update feature register with path and test evidence; no unchecked criterion is implicitly waived.

## Mandatory feature implementation micro-cycle (apply to EACH feature, in order)

Cursor must run this micro-cycle for feature 1, mark it **ACCEPTED**, then feature 2; there is no skipping to the next feature or phase. For every feature:

1. **Inventory:** Inspect repository, migrations, APIs, UI routes, jobs, tests, feature flags, deployment configurations and earlier-phase outputs. Record existing work and do not duplicate it. Treat the original v1.0 specification as normative; mark newly chosen designs as an ADR.
2. **Specify:** Write user story, allowed actors, intended use and risk classification, dependency graph, success metric, explicit out-of-scope, threat/privacy/clinical hazards, failure modes, API/event schemas and UX states BEFORE production code.
3. **Model data:** Define authoritative vs derived tables, tenant/facility keys, row-level permissions, constraints/indexes, lifecycle states, provenance, concurrency, versioning, deletion/retention policy and migration/rollback. Check that synthetic fixture records for this feature are coherent and linked to earlier fixtures.
4. **Implement backend vertical slice:** Build repository/domain/service, validated request/response schemas, idempotent transaction boundaries, outbox/consumer if asynchronous, error taxonomy, authorization and structured audit. Never rely solely on frontend guards; never use LLM text as the basis for consequential clinical writes.
5. **Implement usable UX:** Build every required view from the real API rather than permanently mocked state. Cover loading, initial empty, no results, success, field validation, conflict (409), unauthorized (401), forbidden (403), network error, stale data, delayed processing, retry, cancellation and restricted/offline behavior as relevant. Include accessibility, time zone, locale and responsive layout.
6. **Generate scenario fixtures:** Use deterministic, clearly labeled **SYNTHETIC** patients, staff, events and infrastructure. Provide happy path, alternate path, edge case, adversarial/privacy case and downtime/recovery case. Fixture must include expected result as a test oracle and must be reproducible from a clean checkout.
7. **Test:** Add unit, integration, contract, end-to-end UI, tenant-isolation, authorization, audit, idempotency, concurrency, accessibility, security and relevant load/resilience tests. Add clinical hazard checks or AI golden-set evaluations for corresponding features. Run them, fix them, and report actual commands/results; don't fabricate passing tests.
8. **Operate:** Add trace IDs, PHI-safe logs, metrics, alerts, dashboards, runbook, error budget and basic cost usage as relevant. Test queue/provider/database failures, restart, replay, degraded mode and rollback with evidence.
9. **Document:** Update OpenAPI/AsyncAPI or equivalent, ERD and state diagram, ADR, feature README, intended-use dossier, risk register, user/admin help, operator runbook and acceptance evidence links where applicable.
10. **Gate:** Record all criteria in `progress/feature-register.json` with test commands, observed results, paths and reviewer identity. If any code, UX, security, privacy, clinical/regulatory, docs, migration or operational criterion is missing, set **BLOCKED**; do not begin the next feature. If human clinical/regulatory sign-off is required, await it—an AI agent cannot self-approve.

No runtime `TODO`, stub endpoint, placeholder screen, hardcoded demo-only authorization, mock production persistence or untested catch-all counts as complete. Mocks are permitted in isolated automated tests and the explicitly marked synthetic sandbox only.

## 4. Realistic synthetic acceptance scenario

**Scenario specific to this phase:** Synthetic local lab catalog includes HbA1c, CBC and serum creatinine mapped to known standardized codes where permissible; deliberately inject unmapped code and mismatched units.

**Required proof design:** Create test data and test oracles for (a) end-to-end happy path, (b) no-data/first-run, (c) concurrent or duplicate request, (d) wrong tenant/facility/role or no consent, (e) network/service outage and recovery, (f) stale/versioned source, and (g) rollback/failed migration as applicable. Use `docs/SYNTHETIC_SCENARIOS.md` and fixture IDs; never test against real PHI. Show screenshot/video/UI-test evidence for material UX states.

**Phase-specific hard test focus:** Invalid code rejection, mapping provenance, license boundaries, UCUM dimensional checks, historic reproducibility.

**Special clinical/regulatory boundary:** Apply intended-use analysis; engineering and synthetic tests alone do not establish clinical/regulatory readiness.

## 5. Phase acceptance check and STOP rule

Original exit criteria above must be proven with actual evidence. In addition, before setting the phase ACCEPTED:

- [ ] Every `P05-Fxx` feature is ACCEPTED with exact files, migrations, endpoints/events, UI states, scenario results and test command outputs.
- [ ] Production code uses real services and proper data ownership; no stubbed runtime features or fake success paths.
- [ ] Full in-scope lint, type-check, build, unit, integration, contract, E2E, accessibility, security, tenancy and privacy tests pass; specialized AI/clinical/standards tests pass where applicable.
- [ ] Observability, dashboards/alerts, runbooks, failure recovery, migration reversal or mitigation and safe rollback are documented and exercised.
- [ ] Clinical safety, privacy, regulatory and architecture reviewers have actually signed off when needed. Do NOT invent approval identities.
- [ ] `progress/phase-register.json` records links and actual results for each source exit criterion, current risks and final status.

**Report format:** status (ACCEPTED/BLOCKED), implemented scope, source exit criteria mapped to evidence, feature completion table, files/migrations/APIs/UI, scenario IDs and results, exact executed test commands and outcomes, security/privacy/clinical concerns, SLO and rollback results, unresolved decisions and human approvals. **STOP after this phase. Do not begin Phase 06 without explicit user permission.**
